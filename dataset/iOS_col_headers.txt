*test_date - Date and time of the test in Pacific time zone (GMT -8).
*client_ip_address - This is the IP address from which the request to Ookla's reporting API was generated. The last octet of the user's external IP address is masked for addresses that are not on your network. Full IP addresses are available for your customers. Devices behind networks with carrier grade NAT may appear to share the same IP address.
*download_kbps - The result of the download portion of the test, measured in kilobits per second.
*upload_kbps - The result of the upload portion of the test, measured in kilobits per second.
*latency - The result of the latency portion of the test, measured in milliseconds.
*server_name - The name of the server used for the test. This is typically the city where the server is located.
*server_country - The country where the server used for the test is located.
*server_country_code - The two letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) of where the test server is located.
*server_latitude - The latitude of the server used for the test.
*server_longitude - The longitude of the server used for the test.
*server_sponsor_name - The name of the test server sponsor. Combining server name and server sponsor will create a unique name for each server.
*client_country - The country where the device is located.
*client_country_code - The two letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) of where the device was located.
*client_region_name - The region within a country where the test was conducted. How each country is divided into regions varies country to country, but this is typically the top level region as described in ISO-3166-2. If this field is labeled unknown and the field location type equals 2, we were unable to confidently assign a region to the record and the location is only accurate to the country level.
*client_region_code - The ISO-3166-2 region code of where the test was conducted.
*client_city - The city where the test was conducted. If this field is labeled unknown and the location type field equals 2, we were unable to confidently assign a city to the record and is only accurate to the region level.
*client_latitude - The latitude of the device conducting the test. If location type equals 2, this value is approximate.
*client_longitude - The longitude of the device conducting the test. If location type equals 2, this value is approximate.
*miles_between - Distance (in miles) between user and location of server.
*pre_connection_type - A number representing the device's connection type as detected at the start of the test. 0 = Unknown, 1 = Cell, 2 = Wi-Fi, 3 = GPRS, 4 = EDGE, 5 = WCDMA, 6 = HSDPA, 7 = HSUPA, 8 = CDMA1x, 9 = CDMAEVDORev0, 10 = CDMAEVDORevB, 11 = eHRPD, 12 = LTE; "Standard" extracts recipients receive everything but wifi data (#2). "Advanced" extracts recipients receive all fields.
*post_connection_type - A number representing the device's connection type as detected at the test's completion. 0 = Unknown, 1 = Cell, 2 = Wi-Fi, 3 = GPRS, 4 = EDGE, 5 = WCDMA, 6 = HSDPA, 7 = HSUPA, 8 = CDMA1x, 9 = CDMAEVDORev0, 10 = CDMAEVDORevB, 11 = eHRPD, 12 = LTE; "Standard" extracts recipients receive everything but wifi data (#2). "Advanced" extracts recipients receive all fields.
*isp_name - The name of the device's ISP, derived from the IP address in the client_ip_address field.
*is_isp - A best effort determination if the organization associated with the IP address is an internet service provider or some other kind of organization, such as a government, university, or large corporation. 1 = ISP, 0 = Not ISP.
*carrier_name - Home carrier name associated with IP Address. This does not change when the device is roaming.
*iso_country_code - The two letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) of the country where the device was originally registered.
*mcc - Mobile Country Code (MCC) is a three digit code specific to the country where the network operator is located. A list of code and countries can be found here.
*mnc - The mobile network code (MNC) for the current network operator. A two to three digit identifier specific to a network operator within a given country. When combined with the Mobile Country Code, each mobile network can be uniquely identified. A fairly comprehensive list of MNCs can be found here, but each country regulates their MNCs individually, so codes may appear or change without any notice.
*model - The common name of the device model. Ex. iPhone 7, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Mini
*version - The iOS version number on the device.
*location_type - The method used to determine the device's location. Whenever possible, the speedtest.net mobile application uses the device's location services to determine an accurate latitude and longitude of the device. However, in an effort to maintain a quick and easy user experience, if the device's location services are either unavailable or unable to return an accurate location within a few seconds, we fall back to using third party Geo-IP location services. 0 = Unknown, 1 = GPS / device location services, 2 = Geo-IP.
*gmaps_formatted_address - Full location name including city, county, region, and country, if available.
*gmaps_name - Unabbreviated location name; typically the city where the test is taken.
*gmaps_type - Locality where test is taken. This is typically an incorporated city or town political entity.
*gmaps_country - Country where test is taken.
*gmaps_country_code - Country code where test is taken.
*gmaps_region - Region name where test is taken. This is the first-order civil entity in a country level. Depending on the country, these are states, provinces, or territories, etc.
*gmaps_subregion - Region name where test is taken. This is the second-order civil entity in a country level. Depending on the country, these are county-level names. Not all countries display this information.
*gmaps_subsubregion - Region name where test is taken. This is the third-order civil entity in a country level. Depending on the country, these are the level under counties. Not all countries display this information.
*gmaps_postal_code - Postal code for the test location. The postal code is that same as what is used to address mail within the country.
*client_ipv6_address - Speedtest user's IPV6 address. We mask IP addresses for end users privacy, but show enough to allow clients to see which provider is offering the user's internet service. Please refer to "test_method_a" to see with IP address the test was taken over.
